		<h1>Why did the market crash today?</h1>
		<h4> by Hansen Ucab </h4>
		<p> Earlier this morning, the stock market fell 3% percent already from the all time high of yesterday.
		This is due to the fact that the general consensus of jobs are declining since the Covid hit.
		More is coming and expect the crash to be worse than March lows!</p>

			<h3>Should we be worried?</h3>
			<p>If you diversify, you should not worry. I know some of the big players in investing are saying, diversifying can't protect you from ignorance. That's true. However, as a beginner, you should diversify. As time goes by, you will find out the better stocks to a bad one.</p>
